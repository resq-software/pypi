"""Telemetry setup for the ResQ MCP server.

Provides initialization hooks for OpenTelemetry tracing and metrics.
Currently operates in no-op mode with structured logging as a fallback.

Future integration path:
    1. Install: opentelemetry-api, opentelemetry-sdk, opentelemetry-exporter-otlp
    2. Configure TracerProvider with appropriate exporters
    3. Configure MeterProvider for Prometheus metrics
    4. Add trace decorators to key operations
