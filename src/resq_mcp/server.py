"""ResQ MCP Server - Model Context Protocol server for disaster response coordination.

This module provides the main FastMCP server implementation for ResQ, offering:
- Simulation management via resources and tools
- Drone fleet status and deployment
- Incident validation and response planning

The server uses a lifespan context manager to manage background tasks for
simulation processing and notification delivery.
