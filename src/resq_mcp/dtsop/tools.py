    """Trigger a Digital Twin physics simulation for disaster scenario modeling.

    Queues a high-fidelity simulation job and returns immediately with a
    job ID. Clients should subscribe to the simulation resource URI for
    real-time progress updates and result notification.

    Workflow:
        1. Validate simulation request parameters
        2. Generate unique simulation ID
        3. Queue job to DTSOP backend (Unity/Unreal Engine)
        4. Store job metadata in simulation registry
        5. Return simulation ID and subscription URI
        6. Background processor updates status -> processing -> completed
        7. Client fetches results from NeoFS when completed

    Args:
        request: SimulationRequest with:
            - scenario_id: Unique scenario identifier
            - sector_id: Geographic sector to simulate
            - disaster_type: Physics model (flood/wildfire/earthquake)
            - parameters: Scenario params (wind_speed, water_level, etc.)
            - priority: "standard" or "urgent"
        ctx: Optional FastMCP context for logging.

    Returns:
        str: Message with simulation ID and subscription instructions:
            "Simulation queued with ID: SIM-XXXXXXXX.
             Subscribe to resq://simulations/SIM-XXXXXXXX for updates."

    Example:
        >>> from resq_mcp.dtsop.models import SimulationRequest
        >>> request = SimulationRequest(
        ...     scenario_id="flood-001",

        ...     priority="urgent"
        ... )
        >>> result = await run_simulation(request)
        >>> print(result)  # "Simulation queued with ID: SIM-ABCD1234..."

    Integration:
        Production would:
        - Validate request against simulation templates
        - Check cluster capacity and queue position
        - Store job in Redis with priority
        - Submit to Unity/Unreal Engine processing cluster
        - Return estimated completion time

    Uses reinforcement learning models trained on thousands of simulated
