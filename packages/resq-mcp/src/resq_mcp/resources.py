async def get_simulation_status(sim_id: str) -> str:
    """Get the current status of a physics simulation job.

    Resource endpoint that provides real-time simulation progress and results.
    Supports SSE subscriptions for push notifications on state changes.

    URI Pattern:
        resq://simulations/{sim_id}

    Subscription Behavior:
        Clients can subscribe to this resource to receive automatic updates
        when simulation state transitions (pending -> processing -> completed).
        Server sends resource_updated notifications via SSE.

    Args:
        sim_id: Unique simulation job identifier (e.g., "SIM-A1B2C3D4").

    Returns:
        str: Formatted string with simulation details:
            - Simulation ID
            - Current status (pending/processing/completed)
            - Progress percentage (0-100%)
            - Result URL (NeoFS CID) when completed
            - Original request parameters

    Raises:
        FastMCPError: If sim_id not found in simulation registry.

    Example:
        Client workflow:
        1. Call run_simulation tool -> get sim_id
        2. Subscribe to resq://simulations/{sim_id}
        3. Receive updates as simulation progresses
        4. Fetch result_url when status=completed

    Response Format:
        Simulation ID: SIM-A1B2C3D4
        Status: processing
        Progress: 50%
        Result: N/A (or neofs://sim_results/SIM-xxx.json)

@mcp.resource("resq://drones/active")
async def list_active_drones() -> str:
    """List currently deployed drones in the active fleet.

    Resource endpoint providing real-time fleet status for operator awareness.
    Shows current deployment locations, battery levels, and operational modes.

    URI Pattern:
        resq://drones/active

    Composition comes from the drone service's fleet roster and the live metrics
    come from get_drone_swarm_status(), so this resource and the
    get_drone_swarm_status tool always report the same fleet.

    Returns:
        str: Formatted string with:
            - One line per drone: identifier, capability, home sector
            - A fleet summary: active/total counts, average battery,
              network health, and last ground-station sync

    Raises:
        FastMCPError: If the fleet backend is configured and the request fails.

    Example Response:
        [Active Fleet Status]
        - DRONE-Alpha (Surveillance): home Sector-4
        - DRONE-Beta (Payload): home Sector-2
        - DRONE-Gamma (Relay): home Sector-4

        Fleet: 3/3 active | average battery 82% | network operational
        Last sync: 2026-08-25T20:44:01.123456+00:00

    Use Cases:
        - Operator dashboard fleet overview
        - Resource availability checking before deployment
        - Low battery alert monitoring
        - Sector coverage assessment

    Note:
        Fleet metrics come from the drone service, which reads fleet-api when
        ``RESQ_FLEET_API_URL`` is set and otherwise uses the in-memory mock.
