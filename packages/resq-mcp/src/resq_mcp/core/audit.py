"""Structured audit logging with hashed payloads for ResQ MCP tool invocations.

Implements the "Instrument for logging and detection" recommendation from NSA
PP-26-1834 (May 2026): all tool and model invocations should be logged with the
exact parameters, identities involved, and — where feasible — cryptographic
hashes of results or output, forming the backbone of forensic response.

Records are emitted as single-line JSON on the dedicated ``resq-mcp.audit`` logger
so they can be routed to a SIEM independently of operational logs. Raw parameter
and result payloads are *hashed* (SHA-256) rather than logged verbatim, which
limits raw-data retention and lets a record confirm whether a payload matches a
known reference. The digest is unsalted and deterministic, so it is **not** a
confidentiality control: low-entropy or guessable values (a short id, an enum, a
known URL) can still be recovered by brute force or by matching against candidates.
Do not treat hashing as licence to pass arbitrary secrets through
``parameters``/``result``.

Payload hashing is a content-integrity aid, not a tamper-evident log: on its own
it does not stop an attacker with log access from deleting, reordering, or forging
records, and it does not bind records into a verifiable chain. For tamper
resistance, route the ``resq-mcp.audit`` stream to immutable, access-controlled
storage — WORM or a retention-locked/immutable SIEM index; a generic SIEM sink is
not append-only by default.
