"""Tool preflight guards for the ResQ MCP server.

A single ``preflight`` entry point composes the per-invocation security controls
recommended by NSA PP-26-1834 and normalises their failures into ``FastMCPError``
so tool wrappers stay terse and consistent:

1. **Rate limiting** — bound the per-tool call rate (DoS / fatigue mitigation).
2. **Safe Mode gate** — block mutating tools unless execution is explicitly enabled
   (confused-deputy mitigation).
3. **Identifier validation** — reject raw string arguments that fall outside the
   identifier allow-list (injection / traversal / parameter-forwarding mitigation).

Pydantic-modelled tool inputs are validated at the model boundary; ``preflight`` is
for the raw scalar arguments that arrive outside a model.
