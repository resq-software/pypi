"""Security utilities for the ResQ MCP server.

Provides API key verification for authenticated endpoints using FastAPI's
HTTPBearer security scheme for token extraction.

Note:
    Tokens are verified against a :class:`KeyRing` (the module-level ``key_ring``)
    using constant-time comparison, with zero-downtime rotation and a
    grace-windowed previous token. The ring is seeded from ``API_KEY`` /
    ``API_KEY_PREVIOUS``. For strict OAuth, terminate authentication at the
    gateway/ingress rather than relying on this bearer check alone.

    can keep using the old token until they pick up the new one, after which the
    previous token silently expires. This addresses the token-lifecycle gaps
