"""Per-tool rate limiting for the ResQ MCP server.

Implements the "Denial of service and fatigue-based techniques" mitigation from
NSA PP-26-1834 (May 2026): MCP servers acting as agent orchestrators are
susceptible to prompt storms and recursive task requests that exhaust resources.
A sliding-window limiter keyed per tool bounds the call rate so a single tool
cannot be hammered into a denial-of-service condition.

The limiter is process-local and in-memory: each worker process keeps its own
counters. It therefore does not enforce an aggregate limit across multiple worker
processes on a single host, nor across replicas — a client can dilute the limit by
spreading calls over workers or instances. Any deployment that runs more than one
worker should back the limiter with a shared store (e.g. Redis) so the limit holds
globally rather than per process.
