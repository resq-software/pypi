    """Retrieve the precomputed vulnerability assessment for a sector.

    Part of PDIE (Predictive Disaster Intelligence Engine). Returns the static
    infrastructure and risk profile that predictive models consume as input.
    Read-only: this tool never mutates platform state and is therefore
    permitted under Safe Mode.

    Args:
        sector_id: Sector identifier (e.g. "Sector-1" through "Sector-4").

    Returns:
        VulnerabilityMap: Vulnerability data for the sector, containing:
            - population_density: "low" | "medium" | "high"
            - critical_infrastructure: Named assets in the sector
            - flood_risk: Score 0.0-1.0 from terrain and drainage analysis
            - fire_risk: Score 0.0-1.0 from fuel load and climate data

    Raises:
        FastMCPError: If the rate limit is exceeded, the sector_id fails the
            identifier allow-list, or no vulnerability data exists for it.

    Example:
        >>> vuln = await get_vulnerability_map("Sector-1")
        >>> if vuln.fire_risk > 0.7:
        ...     print(f"High fire risk in {vuln.sector_id}")

    Workflow:
        1. Agent inspects sector vulnerability before planning
        2. High risk scores motivate get_predictive_alerts for forecasts
        3. Confirmed incidents flow to get_deployment_strategy

    Part of PDIE. Surfaces the output of the predictive models that analyse
    weather patterns, sensor trends, and historical data to forecast disasters
    before they occur. Read-only: permitted under Safe Mode.

    An empty list is a valid, meaningful result — it means the sector currently
    has no forecast disasters, not that the lookup failed.

    Args:
        sector_id: Sector identifier to generate forecasts for.

    Returns:
        list[PreAlert]: Zero or more pre-alerts, each carrying the predicted
            disaster type, probability, and time horizon.

    Raises:
        FastMCPError: If the rate limit is exceeded, the sector_id fails the
            identifier allow-list, or the sector is unknown.

    Example:

    Workflow:
